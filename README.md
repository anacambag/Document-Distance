# Document-Distance
Given two words or documents, the user will calculate a score between 0 and 1 that will tell them how similar they are. If the words or documents are the same, they will get a score of 1. If the documents are completely different, they will get a score of 0. The User will calculate the score in two different ways and observe whether one works better than the other. The first way will use single word frequencies in the two texts. The second will use the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) of words in a file.
